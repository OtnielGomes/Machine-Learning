# Machine-Learning
This repository documents my practical journey in Machine Learning using Python. It covers the full modeling cycle: Supervised Learning (Regression, SVM, Trees) and Unsupervised Learning (K-Means, DBSCAN, PCA). Features include hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV), ML pipelines, and model evaluation metrics.
